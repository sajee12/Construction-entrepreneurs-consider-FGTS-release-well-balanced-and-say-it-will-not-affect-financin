**Construction entrepreneurs consider FGTS release 'well balanced' and say it will not affect financing**

Responsible for the strong pressure against the release of part of the FGTS accounts, the construction sector was satisfied with the “calibration” made by the government to prevent the withdrawals from reaching the volume of fund resources that are directed to financing, mainly real estate, at lower interest rates.  
  
For the president of the Brazilian Association of Real Estate Developers (Abrainc), Luiz França, the measure is “well balanced” and does not harm the housing sector. “The housing sector is not going to suffer. The government made all the calculations so that the sector does not suffer. When we talk about the housing sector not suffering, it is the buyer who does not suffer because there will be money for the buyer to buy his house ”, he said. "We have a very strong alignment with respect to this measure proposed by the government."

The government announced that there will be a limit of R $ 500 on withdrawals from active and inactive FGTS accounts. The amount is on account. So, if the worker has an active account (from the current contract) and an inactive account (from past contracts) with at least R $ 500 in each one, he can withdraw R $ 1,000. For the coming year, a new modality was created, called birthday withdrawal. If you choose this option, the worker will be able to withdraw part of the fund every year, but will have to give up rescuing all the resources if he is dismissed without just cause. In this case, he will receive a 40% fine from the FGTS and will withdraw the remainder of the fund in annual installments until the funds run out.

President Jair Bolsonaro signed this Wednesday, 24, Provisional Measure (MP) to allow looting during a ceremony at the Planalto Palace. The MP is effective immediately, but depends on congressional approval within 120 days to be definitively effective.

“I think that (the program) is well balanced and you can't mess with that balance. Because this balance makes it possible for people to withdraw their money and for people who buy a home to also have the ability to purchase, ”said França.

He said he "sees neither the House nor the Senate approving any changes to the program because any changes harm the home buyer." “Brazil has a deficit of 7 million homes. Brazil needs to address this deficit. I don't see anyone proposing to change the budget because it would damage the Brazilian population ”, he commented.

“The government has guaranteed that there will be no impact on civil construction and it is clear that putting R $ 40 billion in the economy improves the country. If there is no impact on investments, it is a good size”, said José Carlos Martins, president of the Brazilian Chamber of Industry of Construction (Cbic). Last week, he said that if a tap was turned on (release for workers) it would be necessary to “turn off the tap or use more water” to avoid drying out the volume. He considered that the limit of R $ 500 will ensure that the funds for financing are preserved. Regarding the new birthday withdrawal modality, Martins said he believes the release through this option will be in a volume similar to the current withdrawals due to unfair dismissal.
